This is my first post using markdown sync!

I can write my posts in markdown and publish them to Bluesky. This is really useful for:

- Drafting posts offline
- Version controlling my posts with git
- Threading multiple posts together
- Syncing replies back to markdown

Pretty cool, right?

This is a reply to my own post. You can add multiple replies in the same file.

Just separate them with --- and they'll be threaded automatically!

And here's another reply in the thread. The script will publish them in order.
