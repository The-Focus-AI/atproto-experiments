# Directory Sync to AT Protocol Blob Store

This utility demonstrates how to store entire directories in the AT Protocol blob store and restore them later.

## How It Works

1. **Incremental Check**: When uploading, fetches previous manifest (if exists) and calculates local CIDs for all files
2. **Upload**: Only uploads new or modified files to your Personal Data Server (PDS) as blobs
3. **Skip Unchanged**: Files with matching CIDs are skipped, reusing previous blob references (no data transfer!)
4. **Manifest**: A JSON manifest is created tracking all files, their paths, and blob references (CIDs)
5. **Anchor**: The manifest is saved as a custom record (`ai.focus.sync.directory`) which anchors ALL blobs, making them retrievable
6. **Post**: A post is created for discoverability, referencing the custom record
7. **Download**: The manifest is fetched from the custom record and used to reconstruct the original directory structure by downloading blobs via `com.atproto.sync.getBlob`

## Key Innovation: Custom Record Type for Blob Anchoring

AT Protocol requires blobs to be "anchored" to records before they can be retrieved. This utility uses a **custom record type** (`ai.focus.sync.directory`) that references all uploaded blobs in a single record. This approach:

- ✅ **Anchors all blobs at once** - One record can hold references to multiple blobs
- ✅ **Scales to many files** - Supports 15+ files (20-100MB total) in a single directory sync
- ✅ **Makes blobs retrievable** - Blobs can be downloaded via `com.atproto.sync.getBlob` endpoint
- ✅ **No feed spam** - Only one post is created for the entire directory

**Limits:**
- Individual blob size: 50MB (PDS limit)
- Total storage: Currently unlimited
- Number of files: No hard limit, tested with 15 files

## Quick Start

### Upload a Directory

```bash
npm run directory-sync upload <directory-path>
```

Example:
```bash
npm run directory-sync upload ./my-documents
```

This will:
- Check for previous sync and calculate CIDs for all files
- Upload only new or modified files (skips unchanged files!)
- Create a custom record (`ai.focus.sync.directory`) anchoring all blobs
- Create a post for discoverability referencing the record URI
- Save a local manifest file (`{directory-name}-manifest.json`) for backup
- Show you the Bluesky post URL and record URI

Example output:
```
📦 Uploading directory: my-documents
✨ Found previous sync from 11/10/2025, 6:28:28 AM
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ⏭️  Skipping: README.md (unchanged)
  ⬆️  Uploading: data.json (226 bytes)
  ⬆️  Uploading: newfile.txt (24 bytes)
  ⏭️  Skipping: notes.txt (unchanged)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
✅ Uploaded 2 new/modified files
⏭️  Skipped 2 unchanged files
📦 Total: 4 files (1013 bytes)
```

### List Synced Directories

```bash
npm run directory-sync list
```

Shows all directories you've synced with their record URIs, file counts, sizes, and creation dates.

Example output:
```
Found 2 directory sync records:

1. my-documents
   URI: at://did:plc:.../ai.focus.sync.directory/3m572snkmkb2a
   Files: 15
   Size: 52000 bytes
   Created: 11/9/2025, 7:02:42 AM
```

### Download/Restore a Directory

**No arguments - download latest to default directory:**
```bash
npm run directory-sync download
# Downloads latest sync to ./restored-dir
```

**One argument - download latest to specific directory:**
```bash
npm run directory-sync download ./my-restored-files
```

**Two arguments - download specific record by URI:**
```bash
npm run directory-sync download at://did:plc:.../ai.focus.sync.directory/... ./restored
```

The download process:
1. Fetches the manifest from the custom record
2. Creates the directory structure
3. Downloads each blob via `com.atproto.sync.getBlob`
4. Reconstructs all files with their original paths

### Delete a Synced Directory

```bash
npm run directory-sync delete <record-uri>
```

Example:
```bash
# Get the record URI from the list command
npm run directory-sync list

# Delete a specific sync record
npm run directory-sync delete at://did:plc:.../ai.focus.sync.directory/3m572snkmkb2a
```

**Important notes:**
- ⚠️ **Deletion cannot be undone** - the record is permanently removed
- ⚠️ **You can only delete your own records** - attempting to delete another user's record will fail
- ℹ️ **Blobs persist after deletion** - the files referenced by the record remain on the server
- ℹ️ **Garbage collection** - blobs will be automatically cleaned up if no other records reference them
- 💡 **Use case** - clean up old versions or remove synced directories you no longer need

### View Files in Browser

**Option 1: Interactive Web Viewer (Recommended)**

Upload the viewer template once and generate shareable URLs for any directory:

```bash
# One-time: Publish the viewer template to the blob store
npm run publish-viewer

# Generate shareable URL for latest sync
npm run viewer-url

# Generate shareable URL for specific record
npm run viewer-url at://did:plc:.../ai.focus.sync.directory/...
```

The viewer features:
- **Gallery view** with image thumbnails and lightbox
- **List view** with file details
- **Direct preview** for images, text, JSON, HTML, PDF
- **Download buttons** for all files
- **No login required** - anyone with the URL can view
- **Fully client-side** - loads manifest and files from AT Protocol

Example URL:
```
https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.sync.getBlob?did=did:plc:xxx&cid=bafkrei...#at://did:plc:xxx/ai.focus.sync.directory/...
```

**How it works:**
1. Viewer template is uploaded as a blob (one-time)
2. Record URI is passed in URL hash (`#at://...`)
3. JavaScript fetches manifest via `com.atproto.repo.getRecord`
4. Files are loaded from blob store via `com.atproto.sync.getBlob`
5. Everything is publicly accessible - no authentication needed!

**Option 2: Static HTML Page**

Generate a standalone HTML file with embedded blob links:

```bash
# Generate for latest sync
npm run web-links

# Generate for specific record
npm run web-links at://did:plc:.../ai.focus.sync.directory/...
```

This creates a local HTML file with all file links pre-generated.

## Manifest Structure

The manifest is a JSON file that tracks everything about your synced directory:

```json
{
  "$type": "app.bsky.sync.directory",
  "name": "my-documents",
  "rootPath": "/path/to/my-documents",
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "README.md",
      "blobRef": {
        "$type": "blob",
        "ref": { "$link": "bafkrei..." },
        "mimeType": "text/markdown",
        "size": 295
      },
      "size": 295,
      "mimeType": "text/markdown",
      "uploadedAt": "2025-11-08T21:58:47.381Z"
    }
  ],
  "totalSize": 1013,
  "createdAt": "2025-11-08T21:58:46.768Z"
}
```

## Use Cases

### Backup Important Documents
```bash
npm run directory-sync upload ~/important-docs
# Restore on another machine:
npm run directory-sync download
```

### Share Configuration Files
```bash
npm run directory-sync upload ~/.config/my-app
# Share the record URI with others
```

### Version Your Project
```bash
npm run directory-sync upload ./my-project
# Creates a snapshot with all file references
# Restore specific version by record URI later
```

## Features

## Known Issues

- Some blobs may return HTTP 500 errors during download (server-side issue)
- This appears to be intermittent with certain blob CIDs
- Successfully tested with 3/4 files in test directory

## Example

Try the included example directory:

```bash
# Upload the example
npm run directory-sync upload example-sync-dir

# List synced directories (shows record URI)
npm run directory-sync list

# Download latest version
npm run directory-sync download ./test-restore

# Download specific version by URI
npm run directory-sync download at://did:plc:.../ai.focus.sync.directory/3m572snkmkb2a ./test-restore
```

## Technical Details

### Incremental Upload

The utility implements smart incremental upload:

1. **Fetch Previous Manifest**: Queries `ai.focus.sync.directory` collection for the most recent sync of the same directory
2. **Calculate Local CIDs**: Uses `multiformats` library to calculate CIDv1 with raw codec and SHA-256 for each file
3. **Compare CIDs**: Compares local CIDs with previous CIDs to detect changes
4. **Skip Unchanged**: Files with matching CIDs reuse previous blob references (no upload!)
5. **Upload New/Modified**: Only files with changed CIDs are uploaded

This approach:
- Saves bandwidth by avoiding redundant uploads
- Speeds up syncing large directories with few changes
- Preserves blob references across versions (content-addressed storage)
- Works even if you rename the directory (compares by directory name)

### Blob Storage

- Each file is uploaded via `agent.uploadBlob()`
- Returns a blob reference with CID (Content Identifier)
- Blobs are content-addressed (same content = same CID)
- AT Protocol automatically deduplicates blobs server-side
- Individual blob size limit: 50MB (PDS limit)
- Total storage: Currently unlimited

### Custom Record Type

The manifest is stored as a custom record:

```typescript
const record = {
  $type: 'ai.focus.sync.directory',
  name: manifest.name,
  rootPath: manifest.rootPath,
  files: manifest.files,
  totalSize: manifest.totalSize,
  createdAt: manifest.createdAt,
};

await agent.com.atproto.repo.createRecord({
  repo: agent.session!.did,
  collection: 'ai.focus.sync.directory',
  record: record,
});
```

This approach:
- Anchors all blobs in one record (makes them retrievable)
- Supports versioning via multiple records
- Can be queried via `listRecords` API
- Creates only one post for discoverability

### File Recovery

To recover files:
1. Fetch the record by URI using `getRecord`
2. Extract the manifest from `record.value`
3. For each file entry, fetch blob using `com.atproto.sync.getBlob`
4. Write blob content to the file path
5. Preserve the directory structure
